All lenses are coated with a multi layer anti-glare film, which gives unparalleled field of view and clarity. Using Nitrogen gas sealed in the the housing of the scope we made it waterproof. In addition to being sealed the nitrogen gas prevents water from forming on the inside of the scope, allowing you to always have a crystal clear sight picture.
