        "elevation": "As one of the main advantages of this scope is the hydrogen filled housing we decided to stress test it. While at an elevation of 10,000 feet the scope showed no signs of leaking gas or faulty o-rings. In the 35,000 halo jump test the scope only showed signs of minor fogging, but zero leaking of gas.",
        "temperature": "Over the course of one day we subjected our scope to two different temperature tests. The first was being frozen for ten hours outside in 10 degree Fahrenheit weather. The second test consisted of being used on an AR-10 in the Mojave desert for 6 hours. In both cases the scope performed well, showing no signs of damage or coating failure.",
        "illumination": "While used in low light conditions for 24 hours without exposure to the sun the scope showed little to no fade in illumination of the optic. Even if the fiber optic cable were to fail the tritium would still be sufficient to light up the optic."
